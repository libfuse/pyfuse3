    This class defines the request handler methods that an pyfuse3 file system
    may implement. If a particular request handler has not been implemented, it
    must raise `FUSEError` with an errorcode of `errno.ENOSYS`. Further requests
    of this type will then be handled directly by the FUSE kernel module without
    calling the handler again.

    The only exception that request handlers are allowed to raise is
    `FUSEError`. This will cause the specified errno to be returned by the
    syscall that is being handled.

    It is recommended that file systems are derived from this class and only
    overwrite the handlers that they actually implement. (The methods defined in
    this class all just raise ``FUSEError(ENOSYS)`` or do nothing).
