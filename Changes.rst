.. currentmodule:: pyfuse3

Release 3.x.y (TBD)
==========================

* Fix long-standing rounding error in file date handling when the nanosecond
  part of file dates were > 999999500.


Release 3.1.1 (2020-10-06)
==========================

* No source changes. Regenerated Cython files with Cython 0.29.21 for Python 3.9
  compatibility.


Release 3.1.0 (2020-05-31)
==========================

* Made compatible with newest Trio module.


Release 3.0.0 (2020-05-08)
==========================

* Changed `create` handler to return a `FileInfo` struct to allow for
  modification of certain kernel file attributes, e.g. ``direct_io``.

  Note that this change breaks backwards compatibility, code that depends
  on the old behavior needs to be changed.


Release 2.0.0
=============

* Changed `open` handler to return the new `FileInfo` struct to allow for
  modification of certain kernel file attributes, e.g. ``direct_io``.

  Note that this change breaks backwards compatibility, code that depends on the old
  behavior needs to be changed.

Release 1.3.1 (2019-07-17)
==========================

* Fixed a bug in the :file:`hello_asyncio.py` example.

Release 1.3 (2019-06-02)
========================

* Fixed a bug in the :file:`tmpfs.py` and :file:`passthroughfs.py` example
  file systems (so rename operations no longer fail).

Release 1.2 (2018-12-22)
========================

* Clarified that `invalidate_inode` may block in some circumstances.
* Added support for using the asyncio module instead of Trio.

Release 1.1 (2018-11-02)
========================

* Fixed :file:`examples/passthroughfs.py` - was not handling readdir()
  correctly.
* `invalidate_entry_async` now accepts an additional *ignore_enoent*
  parameter. When this is set, no errors are logged if the kernel is
  not actually aware of the entry that should have been removed.


Release 1.0 (2018-10-08)
========================

* Added a new `syncfs` function.


Release 0.9 (2018-09-27)
========================

* First release
* pyfuse3 was forked from python-llfuse - thanks for all the work!
* If you need compatibility with Python 2.x or libfuse 2.x, you may
  want to take a look at python-llfuse instead.
